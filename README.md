This project contains three directories, each with a different level of difficulty for practicing your Python skills. You can choose the level that suits your current level of proficiency, or challenge yourself with a higher level. Each directory contains a README file with more details about the exercises and solutions.
To run the exercises, navigate to the directory of the level you want to try, and run the Python file with the exercise number.

## Level 1: Easy
This level contains 5 easy exercises that cover the basics of Python, such as variables, data types, operators, control structures, functions, OOP and modules. You can find more details about each in the README file inside the level 1 directory.
